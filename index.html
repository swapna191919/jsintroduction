  <h3 id="p1">java script :</h3> <p>avaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language.
    It is commonly known as the scripting language for webpages.</p>
    While it’s most famous for web development, many non-browser environments also utilize it, including Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat1.
   <p> JavaScript is weakly typed (dynamically typed), meaning it doesn’t enforce strict type rules.</p>
   
   <h3 id="p2">programminglanguage vs scripting language :</h3>
   Basically, all scripting languages are programming languages. The theoretical difference between the two is that scripting languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted. For example, normally, a C program needs to be compiled before running whereas normally, a scripting language like JavaScript or PHP need not be compiled. Generally, compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs because they are first converted native machine code. Also, compilers read and analyze the code only once, and report the errors collectively that the code might have, but the interpreter will read and analyze the code statements each time it meets them and halts at that very instance if there is some error. In practice, the distinction between the two is getting blurred owing to improved computation capabilities of the modern hardware and advanced coding practices. Another point to be noted is that while classifying a language as scripting language or programming language, the environment on which it would execute must be taken into consideration. The reason why this is important is that we can design an interpreter for C language and use it as a scripting language, and at the same time, we can design a compiler for JavaScript and use it as a non-scripting(compiled language). A live example of this is V8, the JavaScript engine of Google Chrome, which compiles the JavaScript code into machine code, rather than interpreting it.

   <h3 id="p3">variable :</h3>
   a variable is a container which is used for storing

   <h3 id="p4">hoisting:
   </h3>
   Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized. Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared. 
   <h3 id="p5">data types</h3>
   <p>data types are two types</p>
   1.primitive data types
   <p>2.non-primitive data types</p>
<h3 id="p6">primitive datatypes</h3>
The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.
<h3 id="p7">non-primitive datatypes</h3>
The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non-primitive data types. It is also known as derived data types or reference data types.
